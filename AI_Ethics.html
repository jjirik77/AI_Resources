    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Warm Neutrals & Cool Accents) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A user-centric, single-page application designed for exploration rather than linear reading. The structure includes: 1) A welcoming hero section. 2) Sticky navigation for easy access to key areas. 3) An interactive 'Dilemmas' section with clickable cards to reveal detailed information, preventing cognitive overload. 4) An accordion-based 'Solutions' section for layered discovery. 5) A clear, scannable 'Student Guide' with Do/Don't cards for actionable advice. 6) An 'Explore the Connections' section with a dynamic radar chart, allowing users to visualize the relationship between problems and solutions. This structure was chosen to make a complex report digestible and engaging, encouraging user interaction and synthesis of information rather than passive consumption. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Dilemmas: Goal: Inform/Organize. Method: Interactive Cards (HTML/CSS/JS). Interaction: Click to reveal details. Justification: Breaks down complex topics into manageable, user-selectable chunks.
        - Solutions: Goal: Organize/Inform. Method: Accordion (HTML/CSS/JS). Interaction: Click to expand/collapse. Justification: Condenses detailed information into a clean, hierarchical view.
        - Student Guide: Goal: Inform/Guide. Method: Styled 'Do/Don't' Cards (HTML/Tailwind). Interaction: Static. Justification: Creates a visually clear, quick-reference guide for practical advice.
        - Connections Chart: Goal: Compare/Relationships. Method: Interactive Radar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction: Dropdown selector updates chart. Justification: Provides a novel, data-driven perspective on the report, highlighting the interconnectedness of issues and solutions, which is a key report theme. The chart container is responsive and constrained.
